        <p><strong>@elizabethProctor:</strong>They're not lying! I hope they prove you wrong, Danforth! 🙏</p>
        <p><strong>@Rev_Parris:</strong>We should hang them for such treachury! Why would someone as innocent as Abigail lie?</p>

        <p><strong>@cheever_the_enforcer3:</strong> It's totally okay, I'll get right to arresting them! 👮</p>
        <p><strong>@francis_nurse123:</strong> I gave them my word that no harm would come to them! Outragous 😡</p>
        <p><strong>@JohnProctor1:</strong> You better at least consider the content of that deposition if you arrest them 😭</p>

      <div class="caption-section">Cannot believe that this guy would claim lechery upon sweet little Abigail! Had to have him and all of his other devil-loving conspirators arrested. Too bad about Hale leaving the court though. </div>
