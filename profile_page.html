        <p><strong>@elizabethProctor:</strong>They're not lying! I hope they prove you wrong, Danforth! üôè</p>
        <p><strong>@Rev_Parris:</strong>We should hang them for such treachury! Why would someone as innocent as Abigail lie?</p>

      <div class="caption-section">Just had to have 91 people arrested. They all signed a deposition saying all these witches aren't witches. Sorry @Herrick and @Cheever.</div>

        <p><strong>@cheever_the_enforcer3:</strong> It's totally okay, I'll get right to arresting them! üëÆ</p>
        <p><strong>@francis_nurse123:</strong> I gave them my word that no harm would come to them! Outragous üò°</p>

      <div class="caption-section">Cannot believe that this guy would claim lechery upon sweet little Abigail! Had to have him and all of his other devil-loving conspirators arrested. Too bad about Hale leaving the court though. </div>

        <p><strong>@JohnProctor1:</strong>I'm literally not lying. Surely if God were here this would not be happening!</p>
        <p><strong>@Rev_Hale45:</strong>@elizabethProctor was only lying to protect @JohnProctor1! It's a natural lie to tell, so it hardly proves that they're lying. </p>
